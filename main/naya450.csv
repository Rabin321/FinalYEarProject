"Thanks to all for taking my rather offhand comment seriously.  To reiterate my original explanatoin to James: I'm interested in this more on a meta level (how do we approach controversial subjects) than out of deep feelings one way or the other towards Moore and his film; that is, I'm trying to see the forest of making a good article on the film rather than the trees of every factual detail within the film that contributors might have multiple viewpoints about.  For an encyclopedia based around the concept of a Neutral Point of View, any attempt to either counter or defend the content of a subject that is, in itself, an editorial statment seems wrong; such discussions wind up as parasites draining the life and meaning out of an otherwise useful article.  See, for example, something like Roe v. Wade  there's no need to use that article to debate all the pros and cons of the subject involved  there are other articles for that linked at the bottom  just state the facts about the case.  Even if you really consider Moore's movie to be completely indefinsible propaganda (and to risk the Wiki-equivalent of Godwin's Law here), note that the article on Triumph of the Will doesn't feel the need to explain all the reasons why Nazi Germany wasn't all it was cracked up to be.   Similarly, shouldn't we just describe the content of the movie (noting that it is controversial), and then if we want an article about the Bin Laden family departure or whatever we can put the facts about that subject there?   20:19, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)",0

"Referring to her as *Catherine* 

I was told in no uncertain terms that I could NOT refer to anyone, living or dead, by their 1st names on WP, & if a female had a title, she had to be referred to as that throughout her article - ie, *Lady Amy* or *Lady Dudley* for Amy Robsart, even though *Lady Amy* was wrong before she was married as she was the daughter of a knight & had no title, & wrong after Northumberland was attainted & all his children lost their styles as offspring of an earl & a duke, & she did not become *Lady Dudley* until Elizabeth I knighted Robert Dudley near the end of Amy's life nor was she then *Lady Amy Dudley* as legally she was no longer the wife of the son of an earl & duke.  I thought it was simpler to refer to her as just *Amy* throughout rather than explain the changes that occurred with her name & styles, but was told it was against WP *rules* (though I wasn't pointed to a link for it).  Noblewomen are usually called by their 1st names round here as far as I can see, even when they have surnames & are not *of* something!  Mary Boleyn is called *Mary*, not *Lady Carey* or *Lady Stafford*, Catherine Neville is called *Catherine* & not *the Duchess of Norfolk*, etc, & they're not royals.  

As for males, I was told they had to be referred to by their title - ie, *Leicester* -  or last name - ie, *Dudley*.  I was banging head on keyboard going, but - no one just says *the king* all the time or refers to them as *Plantagenet* or keeps changing their titles - ie, Henry of Bolingbroke going from Earl of Derby to Duke of Hereford to Duke of Lancaster to King of England -

 Silesians 

Andrew, I have not made any comments out of a desire to provoke you. I have been editing this article out of a desire to ensure it meets the standards and conventions of the English Wikipedia. I am sorry you had a negative experience with the German Wikipedia, but that is a separate project from this English project. Assuming good faith is a fundamental principle of the English Wikipedia; I advise you to give editors a chance instead of assuming the worst. I inquired about Silesian/Polish because Silesians are sometimes considered a separate ethnic group. I am not sure what you mean by """"reverting the article upside down""""; my editing has been done to ensure that its formatting and style is consistent with other biographical articles. As I do not anticipate being able to copy-edit the article further, I am removing it from my watchlist. Good luck with the article. Olessi  

Thanks for you comments, and in fact fruitful discussion. You are right that the work of a person is most important.
However, there are much present and past propaganda, which destroy the peace. If only some people would show objectivity and patience, as you did, it could be clear up. To mention nationality is however important, since exceptional individuals inspire new generation of a nation. (Unfortunately, nations or ethnic groups will still exist. I have to hope for peaceful coexistence of them, and fair competition. Seems to me that competition has to exit too – best if for fun only.)
I am conscious that English and German Wikipedias are separate projects, but you see, when I approach German Wiki, Dzierzon article the Polish relevant article was attacked by some German/Silesian/Polish guy. It cost me more then here on En Wiki to settle the Pl article well. So sorry if you did feel bad about my attitude, possibly I explained more my excitement.

With Silesian is in short like this: Originally, they were Slavic tribe, spoke Polish, as I mentioned. For some 300 to 500 hundred years there were under German governments. They had bad time as you possibly can imagine. Many of them married with German and were/are of course confused who they are. You know, the pressure on east of resilient nation and of course Polish-German conflicts continued. Finally in 1945 Poland returned and become new problem for some of the natives. Even those who honestly considered himself Polish Silesians at the end of war could be persecuted. There in Poland was complete disorder. Soviets and Communists arrived, most of them real simpletons any way. “National” government - just pro-soviet mafia, was mostly occupied with fight against democratic opposition. Polish borders were shifted. We lost some 20% of our area and millions of people from east territories moved to present west Poland. You can imagine that most of them were not intellectuals at all, some of them completely simple people. They spoke different Polish dialect also. On top of this in the post war, pro-soviet atmosphere criminals found good playground. Well, I do not know if you are familiar with criminal minds – unfortunately I am. This is like gangrene on fresh wound, literally. Thus many of the native Silesian could be robber in Poland, which they wanted so much. I believe that in such conditions many simpletons could use the opportunity accusing natives to be Germans.

Now, the present time, some of the falsely accused people remember the tragic experiences and want rehabilitation and apology – they could be absolutely right. However, there are many Germans who want their property back and some just using opportunity to stir in internal Polish affairs - despite the final border agreement between Poland and Germany signed on 14 November 1990 and governments effort to improve relations.
Finaly I have to say, I beleave that Polish are hospitable and very often naïve. Not many realize that politic need caution. Those who realize that have a hard time to wake up the naïves. Some procentage remember lectures of history, and objectively, too many Germans are toublemakers. I am also convinced there exists something like national character. You can have obviously you own opinion, let me have my own.
Returning to Silesians it is something close to squaring the circle . I wish the true Silesian all the best but I do not want Fith Column  on Polish terytory in addition.

Sorry if I used posibly ofencive """"reverting the article upside down"""" that was in the heat of the battle, wich I still have with Ge Wiki. They just arogantly do not answer if they do not like and refuse mediatior at any imaginative pretext. That sucks.

Sorry and thanks again. Feel free to contact me any time you need.

Certainly nothing to do with Kosova joining Serbia because I said before and I'll say again - if it did, Malcolm would have said it. If he gets things wrong, why is he so well respected by all those reporters in the newspapers listed by Interestedinfairness. Answer that one. Dab, don't confuse the issue.

"Request to Unblock
I began writing the following statement (excepting its two postscripts) before I was blocked. I suspect that User: AuburnPilot had me blocked, in order to prevent me from complaining to administrators about his misconduct. Although I was directed to request an unblock of User: Physicq210, who had blocked me, requesting such of the latter would require that I censor myself, and write as though User: Physicq210 had acted in good faith, and was one of the good guys. That would be surreal, and would give User: Physicq210 a moral legitimacy belied by his actions. And so, the following request for unblocking is directed at any administrator BUT User: Physicq210, but since I’m not a devious sort, I have nothing against the latter reading this. Indeed, I want User: Physicq210 to read it. For if I can be banned from Wikipedia for standing up to censors, then it is vastly preferable to go down fighting, than to go down the long dark road of self-abnegation and self-censorship, including the use of bad English. After all, if I wanted to be a lackey, I could go to graduate school.

WIKI Administrators’ Notice Board Incidents
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents

User: AuburnPilot

A few days ago, User: AuburnPilot began stalking me, checking wherever I had made edits, and going to the articles in question and vandalizing them. He or she has been manipulating Wikipedia rules as cover for what is clearly political censorship. User: AuburnPilot cannot even stand for Wikipedia readers to find out about factual material that upsets his political applecart through footnotes. Zero tolerance!

He claims of any source he politically dislikes, that it is either “spam” or a “blog” (or “POV,” another favorite dodge for those at Wikipedia seeking to censor those who fail to conform to their own POV), even though the one source is a previously published, classic magazine article otherwise unavailable on the Web (http://geocities.com/nstix/waronpolice.html), which the author has seen fit to publish on his Web site, and the other source is the longest, most thorough exposé yet published on the Duke rape hoax (http://vdare.com/stix/070113_duke.htm).

Note that I am not even talking about censoring writing within articles, since I hadn’t done any writing on the articles in question: Crystal Gail Mangum, Michael Nifong, 2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal and Racial profiling.
I’ve been involved in edit wars before, though I have never been the aggressor, and have never initiated an elective edit war, though given the self-assurance that aggressors such as User: AuburnPilot exude, perhaps I ought to reconsider that position. It seems that aggressors rule here.

The reason I am making a formal complaint is that User: AuburnPilot has tonight upped the ante, threatening to have me banned
(http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:70.23.199.239&redirect;=no), if I do not surrender to his censorship. Should you find for me, please serve this individual with the wikiquivalent of a cease-and-desist order. Should you, however, find for the censor, please provide an Index of banned publications and a list of official wikicensors.

P.S. January 19, 2007 115A EST. Since beginning this complaint, I see that User: AuburnPilot has in fact succeeded at getting a crony, User: Physicq210, to block me, thus not only getting administrative support in censoring me, but preventing me from responding to his thuggery. (And no, I am not going to use cutesy, euphemistic language. If I were into such deception, I would have become a liar, er, lawyer, and would be worthless as an encyclopedist.) And I was unable to e-mail User: Physicq210 because I am not logged in and “You must be logged in and have a valid authenticated e-mail address in your preferences to send e-mail to other users.” (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Emailuser/Physicq210)

If this isn’t cyber-Stalinism, I don’t know what is! So, let me get this straight. Stalking and censoring an editor while using the equivalent of smiley faces (User: AuburnPilot’s penchant for saying “Thank you” after vandalizing one’s links) is “civil,” but complaining about such abuse counts as “spam, disruption, incivility, and personal attacks.” If that is verily so, then 2 + 2 = 5.

P.P.S The message here says that I was “temporarily blocked from editing Wikipedia as a result of your disruptive edits.” What the heck is that supposed to mean? For restoring footnotes and links that User: AuburnPilot had vandalized? If that constitutes “disruptive edits,” then you’ve utterly given up on honest English and all human decency. Sorry, but I don’t have any sympathy for the Devil.",1

 Socialistm? 

There are two important features of Smith's concept of the """"invisible hand"""". First, Smith was not advocating a social policy (that people should act in their own self interest), but rather was describing an observed economic reality (that people do act in their own interest). Second, Smith was not claiming that all self-interest has beneficial effects on the community. He did not argue that self-interest is always good; he merely argued against the view that self-interest is necessarily bad. It is worth noting that, upon his death, Smith left much of his personal wealth to charity.

Good!  Let's all make sure we put forth the idea that Adam Smith was a socialist.  That's the wikipedia way!""",0

"Lol, you know what i meant. Whichever president came before Hafez (i just new he was president before assad) has considerable foreground of support, in which his supports would have freaked out because of the coup. They would have claimed instability would arise, as assad's supporters are trying to use in their defense. 

What i am trying to say is that although Bashar assad had good economic and international policies for Syria, you should not fear a non-baathist potentially being elected.  Syria's economic and international policies won't change (iran would still be a major factor in Syrian life considering the buisness deals stakes and cultural exchanges) , the only this that would change are social freedoms, and for the better. Also every country had a revolution and they are still alive today. The Muslim brotherhood in Syria is weak, even weaker than the islamist prescence in Libya. The rebels in Libya had 80-90% support, as we see now, and yet could hardly take control without NATO. What chance does the Syrian Muslim brotherhood have? None. If anything, nonviolent protests weaken the resolve of the Muslim brotherhood, making them less of an influence in the everyday life of Syrians. As you know I am pro Syria and Armenia, just not pro Assad. Unlike Armenia where people like Sargsyan and Kopcharyan were democratically elected, Assad was not (no one ran against him because they were not allowed).",0

 Greek love 

I'm looking for a way to extricate myself honorably from this mess. I'm leaving a note here because you closed this AfD, where I made a commitment to do as you instructed in the closing statement. There are two editors who have long sought to delete or eviscerate the article, one of whom has used a series of user names (unacknowledged on his current user page but available , so at first glance it may appear on the talk page there are more than two editors in the 'suppress' camp). I complain here about their coordination. Other editors, including  and I simply can't do it any longer. I haven't changed my position on the validity of the article, but I've been accused (on various talk pages, and never the appropriate notice boards) of edit warring, ownership, disruption, and even pedophilia by implication, all for trying to carry out what the community decided. I'm done. I need to limit my time on Wikipedia at present, and wish for that time to be spent pleasantly and productively. When I've made a commitment, though, it grieves me not to keep it. I'm not asking you to do anything: I'm just explaining why I can't keep my word as given at the AfD.   

Wow, that is a mess.Certainly no hard feelings  on my end, it is clear you endeavored in good faith to improve the article. I have found that knowing when to walk away is an essential skill, not only here but in the real world. Sometimes your presence, despite your best intentions, is harmful rather than helpful, and sometimes a dispute just isn't worth it anymore. Best of luck in your future endeavors here.   

 Mailchimp 

I'm not that bothered but I think that the Mailchimp speedy deletion was a mistake.  It did cite that it was one of the more important email marketing programs so it was stating the importance - something that was supposed to be the original problem.

"""::::::Agreed, although it means bloating the alternative title by yet another word. I was concentrating on the Polish attitude here, as it clearly provides the starting point for the article at hand. Obviously, if the article is to be written from a supra-national perspective, at least the Czech experience needs to be included. Czechoslovakia, being the only functioning democracy in the region by the 1930s, had closer ties with the West than Poland did, and was """"betrayed"""" in a much more obvious and tangible way than Poland was: The West politically accepted the country's territorial mutilation, which was not the case with Poland. 

That said, I am not sure if the inclusion of countries such as Finland, the Baltics, Yugoslavia, or even Ukraine (which had never been independent in the first place) is a good idea. While the West could have arguably done more to assist any of these societies before and after the war, I think that the article's focus should be on Poland and Czechoslovakia in order not do dilute the whole issue. After all, there were dissidents in Germany and the Soviet Union, too, who were harbouring grudges towards Western politicians because of their appeasement policy.  19:06, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Are you being facetious? if not, you would have relayed the same message to Jza and MRSC as my words were no more stern than theres. If you would like evidence for any of the claims made on the talk, then I will only be too glad to provide. You also failed to provide diffs in your message to me, in regards to which words you're claiming are offesive, perhaps WP:Assume good faith.

The two users constantly harass and follow me to articles making disruptive edits in violation of numerous Wikipedia guidelines (WP:HARASS is just one). For example the removal of third party references from articles which don't suit their POV, without entering an edit summary (considered by Wikipedia guidelines as bad faith and a violation of WP:BLANK). The violation of WP:NEO by adding derogatory neologisms to the articles of organisations who they do not personally agree with, despite being made aware of the policy, despite not having any reference to the said organisation being described with said neologislm and despite the community majority constantly removing the derogatory term.  The same """"tag team"""" practise can be shown to be used against numerous other editors who edit articles on British culture and trad counties, not just against me. Again, if you would like evidence just ask.

It would seem however, looking at the messages on your talkpage above, especially the lovely intertude under """"UK mediation"""" section, that Jza messaged you (somebody he seems very familiar with) in violation of WP:CANVAS. Specifically the section on Wikipedia:CANVAS#Campaigning may interest you. If you're going to be an admin, may I suggest you please make yourself familiar with the policies and guidelines I have referenced in this message.

I've worked in digital cash for about 20 years; it's clear that digital bearer token money (i.e. Chaumian blinded money) could be used to represent arbitrary assets.  There is a difference between distributed and centralized systems, and right now the only really viable distributed model is blockchain based, but the distinction shouldn't be """"cryptocurrency vs. non-cryptocurrency"""", but """"blockchain-based cryptocurrency vs. blinded token cryptocurrency"""".  They're both distinct from account-based money.

There are ways in which blinded money is actually *more* cryptocurrency than blockchain money  by eliminating the historical record of linkability inherent in the blockchain or account-based systems, blinded tokens are inherently fungible, which supports negotiability and finality.

"Now I know why I wasn't that good at school and I think it wasn't because I was dumb or lazy...it was because of the hell I've lived in all my life...this house sucks and the worst is that it doesn't seem to, to outside people, since my parents are great actors.
Just to give an example... I've been to church until like a year ago despite I never liked catholiscism and in fact, I feared it when I was a kid.
and why did I do that? I did that because I didn't dare have a rational conversation with my parents, and what happened when I did? I was called a terrorist by my fucking father, among other things... I had to cry for days, I was ignored, made fun of and insulted... what did my mother do? she didn't force me to be a catholic like my father tryed to do, but she didn't help me either, she just seemed to agree with him, while agreeing with me when he wasn't there... just like an evil cat.
and she does just that all the time, she complains about my father's obssesive controlling personality with me and my sister, but when my father says all his bullshit to me she never says a thing, but it's different with my sister(16) because my mother supports her against my fathers crazy temperament.
my father treats me like I'm a 30 year old drug addict living off his money. he doesn't get that I'm studying a career and that(like everyone here, I dunno about other countrys) he has to pay for it... it's not like I'm not doing anything! my 'god'...
whenever I'm happy what do they do? I swear to my life that they FUCK THINGS UP FOR ME no matter what. 
and whenever I'm sad (that's most of the time arround them, because I don't dare to even joke arround with them since they are offended by anything) whenever I'm sad they come with theyr you need god in your life bullshit.
or theyr see? we are right and u r wrong bullshit...
I'm sick of this, I just wanna get a fucking job, get out of this house and lead a NORMAL LIFE where I'm not issolated from my friends  and can go out and have fun with them without being threatened with loosing the internet conection or being taken out of college...
and my sister? according to my friends who kind of know my situation... she's envious of me and that's why she treats me like shit and doesn't even respect my room like I do hers.
and can you believe I love them???? I do , and that's why I think Im looney, because this isn't possible...
I forgive them every single time! but If I want to hold on to my physical and mental health and have somwehat of a good future, I have to develop a stiff upper lip and not give a shit about them anymore.and I should even take regenge according to most of my friends! but I don't even want to!..I just wanna be left alone anf try to forget all I've been through... I just wish it was physical abusse so I could show my scars and make a point, but this way...anyone can think I'm crazy.
Maybe this is the cause of all my existential doubts, because I don't have anything to be sure of and feel confident about in my everyday life becase my family does the job of ruining everything for me.

I'm sorry for all the swear words, but I had to express how I felt somewhere, also I think I'll erase this because I don't think it's allowed at all on wikipedia, it's just that there's so much rational people here that I think I can get some good advice and I've nowhere else to turn.",0

 Eternity clause 

You are right about the referenced article is about not chaning the fundamental principles of democracy. And this is why I have a BIG problem with Lone boatman.

He then took revenge by changing the entire article into a catch all (international page in which he redefines 'eternity clause' as a """"term"""" used internationally instead of the colloquial description specific to Article 79 paragraph (3) of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany. He added the additional data at the top of the page only in an act of revenge and to cover up the 'eternity clause' article.

And when I told him he had wrongfully duplicated the """"entrenched clause"""" and again was wrongfully pushing the word """"constitution"""" (which Germany does not have), he then added """"Basic Law"""" to his change. Then several editors suddently (for the first time) showed up and one of them deleted the entire 'eternity clause' article, leaving only what Lone boatman had put in. Wikipedia is apparently no place to safeguard an article, even a properly referenced article, which it was.

 Edits proposed to plot description 

""""“Joliet” Jake Blues is released from the Joliet Correctional Center after serving three years of a prison sentence after being convicted of armed robbery.""""

Entry for Joliet Correctional Center.

""""Jake is irritated at being picked up by his brother Elwood in a battered former Mt. Prospect, Illinois police car, instead of the Cadillac The Blues Brothers used to own.""""

It's unclear here, however the Caddy Jake refers to may be Murph and the Magictones' pink vehicle first seen in the """"Howard Johnson's"""" scene where Jake and Elwood phone Maury Sline and are blasted the flame-throwing mystery woman. 

The Blues Brothers visit their childhood home, a Roman Catholic orphanage, Saint Helen-of-the-Blessed-Shroud Orphanage. From Sister Mary Stigmata (Kathleen Freeman), The Blues Brothers learn that a property tax lien on the orphanage property will be foreclosed upon unless five thousand dollars in property taxes is remitted on its behalf to the county (the associated church has elected instead to sell the building to the Board of Education rather than pay the tax assessment).

Part of the film's humour is the actual name of the orphanage. Credit to Kathleen Freeman. People erroneously thing charities and churches are completely tax-exempt; however the exemption most notably only extends to Federal income taxes. The property tax bill would probably have remained an unforeclosed lien had the church not decided to sell voluntarily to the Board of Education.

""""At the advice of their childhood mentor, Curtis (Cab Calloway), The Blues Brothers attend an evangelical church service at Triple Rock Baptist Church, led by the Reverend Cleophus James (James Brown), where Jake has an epiphany: The Blues Brothers can legitimately raise the funds by re-forming their rhythm and blues band, The Blues Brothers’ Show Band and Revue.""""

Credit to Cab Calloway and James Brown.
  
""""As The Blues Brothers drive past a doughnut shop and Nelson Funeral Home in the Bluesmobile, Elwood’s driving alerts two Illinois State Police troopers, Trooper Daniel (Armand Cerami) and Trooper Mount (Steven Williams), who, after pursuing The Blues Brothers into a quiet, secluded residential area, learn from their in-car SCMODS (State-County-Municipal Offender Data System) computer terminal of Elwood’s suspended driver's license. When Trooper Daniel and Trooper Mount attempt to place Elwood under arrest, Elwood speeds off, escaping by driving and crashing through, with the Illinois State Troopers in pursuit, the Dixie Square Mall.""""

Entry for Bluesmobile; since location in Chicago and Illinois is obviously a major plot element, reference that the particular law-enforcement agency here is the ISP; SCMODS article already exists, with explanation of the meaning, in this context; article exists for Dixie Square Mall. 

""""After parking the Bluesmobile in an alley-end compartment next to a high-voltage transformer (hence the Bluesmobile’s remarkable magical abilities) and arriving at Elwood’s home, a hotel for transients, The Blues Brothers are mysteriously unharmed from a bazooka attack launched by a mystery woman (Carrie Fisher).""""

Credit cast member Carrie Fisher; this scene is cut from many televised versions, DVD featurette commentary explains that Canadian actor Aykroyd felt this scene explained the Bluesmobile's magical abilities, yet director Landis felt this was not transparent.

""""The next morning, just as the Illinois State Troopers who attempted to arrest Elwood the previous evening, with the help of Parole officer Burton Mercer (John Candy) as to the true address of “the elegant abode of one Elwood Blues” (because Elwood had ‘falsified his renewal’ and ‘put down ten sixty West Addison’, the street address of Wrigley Field) attempt to serve an arrest warrant at Elwood’s tiny room. The mystery woman detonates a bomb that demolishes the building, which inadvertently saves The Blue Brothers from another attempted arrest.""""

Candy's character was important because he assisted in locating Elwood's abode; the 'Wrigley Field bit' is important plot-element humor.

""""Elwood proceeds to his “straight job”, on the assembly line at an aerosol-can manufacturer, takes several cans from the line and places them in his briefcase, and visits the plant manager, quitting his job, citing a decision to become a priest (curiously, Elwood’s supervisor’s office is adorned with a U.S. flag and an Illinois state flag, suggesting that the aerosol-can manufacturer in an enterprise owned by the government of the State of Illinois—or else simply that Elwood’s supervisor thought it would be cool to adorn his office with",0

Well, 4twenty42o, I certainly don't put on any show here, but if you find it amusing, please have a laugh. Certainly I don't see any fun in it whatsoever. I sure hope that NeilN would take another approach and not jump the gun as he certainly did this time. Also, yes, I am frustrated, and I most certainly have the best reason in the world for that. Mario Roering is not only lying, violating my copyright, slandering, posting defamation etc. here on Wikipedia harming Genseiryu and myself etc. but he does so with dedicated pages in my name on his own homepage and other sites on the Internet. Keeping up with Mario Roering and posting complaints and requests for removal of content on sites such as YouTube, free webhosting etc. is a full time job. Mario Roering has absolutely no just cause for doing what he does, and his involvement here at Wikipedia is no different from his exploiting every other possible way on the Internet to slander me. On the contrary. That is why I do not need anymore crap from anyone, and perhaps I do tend to sort people a little too fast, even though their actions may not have been ill intended, but perhaps the last situation illustrates quite well exactly why I tend to do that? Another good example is when both Mario Roering and I were blocked a few weeks back, Mario Roering was unblocked just an instant later, but I was not, even though we posted the exact same reasons for requesting the unblock. Ever since 2005, when all this started, Mario Roering's candy-talking, deceits and lies have won him favors here on Wikipedia from the admins and others. The last action from NeilN would in my best opinion constitute yet another one such favor. I have never ever postulated, that these favors were done or initiated on purpose, but I have, and I still do claim, that lack of interest for fairness, facts and true intentions, makes this kind of manipulation by Mario Roering possible. And it should not be possible. EVERYONE should be equal to rules and regulations, but for Mario Roering, on mcuh more than one occasion, that has indeed not been the case. Mario Roering has been able to continue his deceitful and ill intended ways on Wikipedia for almost 5 years now. When will it ever stop? As long as it is this easy for Mario Roering to manipulate everyone he wants to, I cannot see the end of it. Even though I still believe that Mario Roering was using NeilN, and that NeilN did indeed jump the gun here siding with one party, instead of issuing equal consequences for both, I will let this one go and """"reset"""" the system. But what I have written here, should be taken into account and something serious should be done about Mario Roering's methods and ways.   """,0
"To say anything of the Sikh Gurus taking any inspiration from Bhakti movement is fallacious. Sikh Gurus included the writings of other saints in the Guru Granth Sahib; implying that as taking inspiration from them is false.

From Parasaraprasna, Kapur Singh, Guru Nanak Dev University Press, Amritsar

 Thus those who see in the origin and contents of the Sikh
movement anything of this VaiSlJavism or the historical Bhakti
movement of the Middle ages, which was based on this VaiSDavism
or cognate propositions, show a complete lack of understanding ofthe
real nature of Sikhism. Beyond the fact that Sikhism is of historical
proximity to this Bhakti movement of the Middle ages, and that it
somewhat partakes of the atmosphere and temper of VaiSDavist
climate, it has not much in common with the latter. Among the
principal features of this climate are its anti-Brahmanical attitude, its
preference for vernaculars26 over Sanskrit, its total surrender theory,
such as Lokacarya's marjara27 doctrine, its stress on devotion through
image-worship rather than through knowledge, and its own peculiar
forms of ritualism, such as caste-marks.

It is easy to demonstrate that similarities of Sikhism with some of
these features are not so intimate or fundamental as to suggest any
direct or indirect borrowing.",0

"There is rather too much POV in the Politics section. (It incorrectly links conservatism to the KKK, fundamentalism and farming.  Well, no. The KKK died out pretty fast.

"Need proper reliable citations 
I appreciate the hardwork of authors in providing references/citations, but most of them dont obey wiki standards like
direct ref to inscriptions and refering to non english sources.

Almost year back I have asked for reliable citations for the claim in this WP that Kota Kings are Kammas,
3 citations have been provided and the funny thing is two of those are famous historian books which
clearly say that Kotas as Rachavaru (kshatriya Rajus) and belong to dhanunjaya gotra. Kota Kings are ancestors to Rajus clans Datla, Dantuluri and Jampana. Plz refer thos two historical books:

2. pg 149,159 from A History of the Early Dynasties of Andhradesa, by B.V Krishna Rao 

The two authenticated historical books clearly say Kota Kings as Rachavaru (Rajus), nowhere in the entire two books Kota kings is linked to Kammas.
The third book by Mr. KB Chaudary is unreliable as it is not inline to wiki standards (WP:PRIMARY, WP:OR and WP:SYNTHESIS)

Re 
I tagged Byron Long for speedy deletion since it appeared to be entirely unreferenced, which, given the controversial nature of the subject matter, would constitute a serious WP:BLP violation.  WP:BLP states that Administrators encountering biographies that are unsourced and controversial in tone, where there is no NPOV version to revert to, should delete the article without discussion (see Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion criterion G10 for more details).  Looking through the page history, however, it appears that there actually was a reference for the article, which I have restored.  
CSD G10 does use the term """"negative in tone"""", which is a somewhat unfortunate choice of words.  The more fundamental policy here appears to be Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons, which states that """"biographies that are unsourced and controversial in tone"""" should be speedily deleted.  The underlying issue is not whether we believe that a description of a living person as a """"porn actor"""" is actually negative.  Rather, for WP:BLP purposes, the issue is whether, if an article incorrectly described someone as a """"porn actor"""", such a description would be regarded as defamatory for the purpose of Wikipedia:Libel  that is, whether such an incorrect description, if widely believed, might be likely to have a significantly adverse effect on the employment prospects or general reputation of the subject of the article.  I would contend that describing someone as a """"porn actor"""" is sufficiently """"controversial in tone"""" to invoke WP:BLP concerns for the speedy removal and/or deletion of any unreferenced claims of this nature.

Confused
Don't worry but I think somebody got confused while usign LHD and RHD back and forth beetwen different countries, so for example, Spain is LHD or RHD? the part about Gibraltar made me get confused about it.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 98.226.204.140   

Gibraltar has not been part of Spain since 1713, so the British authorities applied their own laws, including the rule of the road. By 1929, driving on on the left while having a land border with a country that drove on the right became impractical, so that's why Gibraltar change on 16 June of that year.  

History
Do we have any reliable evidence about the historic foundations of LHD/RHD are? I think the article could benefit from adding any info to this effect.
On numerous occasions, I have heard that left hand driving has its roots in knights passing each other with the lances in their right hand. However, i have never been able to find any evidence of this. 
  

-Please do excuse me for sounding a bit daft, but I'm not sure I understand the question. Isn't that what the entire article is about? In addition, I think the problems ascertaining the specific history are quite well-presented.   

Sweden
Under Safety factors it says
""""Research in 1969 by J. J. Leeming showed countries driving on the left have a lower collision rate than countries driving on the right. This research is questioned in Peter Kincaid's book on the rule of the road,[citation needed] but some countries that have switched to driving on the right, such as Sweden, have seen their long-term accident rates increase by more than any increase in traffic volume[citation needed]."""" The red part is totally made up, and the opposite is the truth. The number of accidents was cut in half from the first day of right hand driving, and has not increased substantually since then. Swedish right hand driver 83.255.35.43  

H'm. This what you're saying doesn't quite make sense, either. The number of crashes will surely have gone up since 1967. Perhaps you mean the crash rate (per vehicle-kilometre travelled, per thousand vehicles registered, etc.) has declined, which would make sense since that's what's been happening in just about every first-world country over the last four decades. 

Nevertheless, the assertion you call attention to is unsupported, has been for quite some time, and at the very least is questionable. We can remove it from the article unless/until someone cares to add it back with reliable support. — T·C

 Dagen H videos 
If anyone else has found this already and beaten me to it, I'm sorry to be redundant. After a long night of trolling the internet for hours I finally came across the holy grail of Dagen H-related video. Here's the link.

It's from TV Sveriges. That link will take you to the live television coverage from 4.45am to 5.15am. There's yet another clip from 5.15-5.30 and further clips down the right-hand menu to different reports throughout Sweden at different intervals throughout the day. It chronicles the entire switch in immense detail, though be warned that the dialogue is entirely in Swedish (as is the website) so its main function is simply for those of us who draw immense excitement from watching these events transpire. The site also hosts (further down) the news bulletins for the various anniversaries right up to 1997.

The Cats of Coward County - The Cats of Coward County is a fictional story about a scientific experiment that accidentally resulted in a group of cats developing some human like characteristics. Since they were cats first, their cat personality was dominate but they were able to develop new skills, and memories, and, they could talk. These are some of the humorous stories involved with this group of cats that try so hard to organize and develop their own little town, a town called """"Cat City.” The personality and humorous antics of each cat living in Cat City comes to life as the stories unfold. Mouser, a real cat, is fictionalized as the Father of Cat City and is recognized as the Mayor of the town and attempts to guide the other cats in the development of their town and solving it's many problems. The many stories are filled with humor showing how the cats dealt with their new found thoughts that are filled with both human and cat memories. You will be introduced to Cat City, how it got started, what it looks like, and how the cats make it work for them. You will get to know Vern and Pam who helped the cats get their town started and how they helped the cats organize all the different parts of their town.

The Cats of Coward County is designed to add a new perspective to your imagination and a sense of humor and how cats might evolve in these circumstances. ISBN: 978-1-61582-406-9

Sweet Water Canyon - Sweet Water Canyon is a fictional story about the trek of a group of pioneers crossing the country in 1859 from a Midwestern town and going west. They traveled together in a wagon train. Dozens of wagon trains had already made it across the country and had pretty well marked the way, if there is such a thing, for those that followed. They traveled by wagon train because the promised railroad going from east to west was far behind schedule and seemed like a distant, hope. It describes one type of hardship and danger the early pioneers had to endure. This is the story of one part of one journey and the impact it had on the entire wagon train.

Re Talk:Dinosaur """"Another error""""
I'd respond to your query instantly except that I'm not going to make life easier for those (not you) who have twice reverted my edits to Dinosaur - if it were not for the reverts I'd have quietly corrected the item. But I've noticed your much more friendly and co-operative tone in our few discussions and the many well-earned congratulations in your Talk page, and I'll be very happy to co-operate with you on any other article if it is appropriate.   

Re Physiology of dinosaurs I'd be happy to contribute. I think I already suggested that the warmblooded/coldblooded debate should be a separate article - in fact Physiology of dinosaurs started life as """"Warmbloodedness of dinosaurs"""" and I was fairly happy that it was coherent and well-structured after my last edit under that title (although of course there was room for improvements). Physiology of dinosaurs looks the kind of article that will spawn further """"more details"""" articles as we find more material.

Re your suggestion of a """"Dinosaur behavior"""" article, I agree the relevant section of Dinosaur is getting too long. But I suspect (totally off the top of my head) that there's too much variation for one article when you consider differences in: time (150M years); size; lifestyle (predator / scavenger / browser / grazer); environment; and specific clades (although clade may not be a helpful grouping, look at lions and tigers). My inclination (off the top again) would be to handle this aspect bottom up, e.g. """"behaviour of dromaesosaurs"""", """"behaviour of large tyrannosaurids"""", """"behaviour of Jurassic sauropods"""", """"behaviour of large late Cretaceous ceratopsians"""" (bound to be different from that of smaller, earlier ones because the big, late ones had horns). Even working out how to structure a set of articles on this topic probably needs input from people with knowledge of specific groups / periods. But I'm game for it, as I think structuring a large set of related articles is a current weakness in Wikipedia (I'm involved in an attempt to remedy that in 1 subject area, History of IBM mainframe operating systems, see the Talk page). 

Re the conflicts, see User talk:Philcha#Dinosaur (period concerned is Jan - Mar 2007) and Talk:Dinosaur#Corrections_urgently_needed (21 Nov 2007). That's twice I've corrected errors in the article and had my edits reverted. In the earlier instance I pointed out the errors on Talk:Dinosaur and other defects and balance issues in Oct 2007 and nothing happened for 3 months. So I edited in Jan 2007 and my edit was reverted almost instantly. My current impression is that a certain clique thinks it owns that article and would rather revert edits not controlled by them than see the article improved by someone who's not a member of the clique and / or who (in the earlier instance) interprets Wikipedia guidelines differently from them. The more I look round Wikipedia the more places I can see where I can contribute, so I don't have time play games with such people.  ([[",0

"Notable alumni ==

This section badly needs cleaning up. I am happy so to do but I should like to seek support, here, first. A prerequisite is that attendance at the school should be reliably sourced - no source must mean no inclusion. The second prerequisite is notability. A page is not needed to demonstrate notability but it helps! Looking at the red-links some have no claims to notability and for some the claims can be simply tested. Take Mike Pointing for example. If he has played in a competitive match for Harlequins first team then he meets WP:Athlete. If he has just played for their academy then he doesn't. If Michael Latham is an influential film-maker why doesn't he have a page? My view is that if an editor thinks that an alumnus is notable and feels strongly that they should be included in this list then write a stub! It is always quicker to write a stub than have a long debate trying to establish their notability separately.

To deal with this situation efficiently I am proposing that red-linked or unsourced people should be moved here. This preserves the information that we have about them and they can then be moved back to the article as sources are found or notability is demonstrated. Views, please.   

I'm with you, TerriersFan. Move the redlinks here or give a diff to the deletion; they can be added back when the burden of proof is met.   

I too agree with your suggestion. Thanks for taking this on.

 November 2015 

 Hello, Callmemirela! It is nice to meet you. Your help in improving the page for Criminal Minds (season 11), specifically the episode section, is much appreciated!I'm glad you kept me on my toes about putting the episode summary in my own words, so as not to violate any copyright laws; for that I'm quite grateful to you. Criminal Minds is, by far, my favorite show and I love to help keep fellow fans informed.

However, in my entire time editing Criminal Minds pages - which has been a little while; while I am fairly new to Wikipedia, this account was created with the (2) at the end because my previous account of the same name was inaccessible because I forgot my password lol - I have not once, by any editor, been asked/required to provide refernces for the production codes. Title, writer, director, and air date absolutely require references! But the production code is usually confirmed in one of the references whether it be title, writer, director, air date or any combination therein, added to the fact that the air dates can help determine the order in which the episodes will air, they are almost always confirmed.

Although, I have come to understand there can be an exception in which the production codes can serve quite useful! This is when episodes air out of order, an example of which would be in Season 10, 1006, """"Boxed In"""", was aired before 1005, """"If the Shoe Fits"""", because """"Boxed In"""" was the Halloween episode and it was scheduled to air on 11/05 whereas """"If the Shoe Fits"""" was scheduled to air on 10/29; to resolve this, they merely switched their air dates, however, the production codes remained the same, therefore letting people know that they were aired out of order to accommodate Halloween. In that case, I believe it was briefly required to include references with the production codes. That, however, was the only time I've ever been required to provide a reference for a production code.

I've posted references for all of the upcoming production codes to satisfy your need for me to do so and prove to you that I would not post those codes without knowing that their validity can eventually be found through other references. In conclusion, I absolutely agree with you that I needed to avoid violating copyright by denoting the summaries in a vernacular (lexicon; vocabulary; my own words) more unique to me, basically, to make them be more so in my own words, but I don't agree that the production codes need referencing. You are the first person who has ever asked me to do so. I do want you to know, though, that I always use reliable references for my episode title, writer, director and/or air date contributions, and that I take copyright violation (avoiding it!) very seriously!

I really appreciate your willingness to help make the page as accurate as possible; that is my objective as well. I just don't think that it is necessary to reference the production codes, since all episodes have aired in order, thus far, and we (the fans) have been given no reason to believe they won't continue to do so. When it is required due to scheduling changes, I'd be happy to post it. I hope we can resolve this minor misunderstanding. Happy editing!

While the sources don't actually say they're the children of David Cross, I'm happy to assume good faith on the matter, though it'd be nice if there was a source somewhere that said he did have 3 children, I'll have a look see if I can dig anything up.

The problem with titling a geographic article based on """"who should control the area"""" rather than """"who does control the area"""" is that it leads to endless arguments over who has the better claim.  Using """"who does control the area"""" makes people unhappy, but at least it's easy to determine.

As a case in point: the city of Jerusalem.  Who """"should"""" control and name it?  The current Israeli nation?  The Palestinians?  The British?  they conquered it in 1917.  Or should it be Turkey, the successor to the Ottoman Empire, who controlled it prior to that?  Egypt, who controlled it in the 13th century?  Germany? Fredrick II held it during the Crusades.  The Vatican, as spiritual successor to the Crusaders?  Italy, as successors to Rome?  Any surviving descendants of the Jebusites, who the Israelites displaced in antiquity?

Far too much of the globe is claimed by multiple groups for """"what it should be called"""" to work as a naming policy.   19:26, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)""",0

Well, thank you very much for the note and for the block! I mean it. 
I am very,very happy with this block. I could not forgive myself for giving in to bullying. Now, when I am really blocked for fighting bullying maybe I will be able to forgive myself, and it is very important for me.
I'd also like to thank you because it is one of the most complete responses I've got from arbcom. 
This block is also one of the most unusual blocks that I hope will be written with golden letters in the history of wikipedia. Why? Well, because I was blocked on English wikipedia for """"harassing"""" Gwen Gale on meta. Before today my last contribution to English wikipedia was made to my talk more than a month ago. 
Am I blocked because Gwen Gale is """"a protected admin""""?    
I'd like to ask you two questions please:
 In accordance with this policy how exactly  I """"harassed"""" Gwen Gale? I am asking because in my request for comments I supported each and every statement I made with the differences.
You said """"I have reblocked your account with the usual flags enabled."""" Does this mean that the reblock was your own decision or it was decided by arbcom, and, if it was decided by arbcom, could you please fix the message?  """,0

"""

You didnt sign so I do not know who you are, maybe you are a mormon in chief under disguise, I do not accept unsign and undated messages on this page.
You are warned.
You have, you and different mormons users, vandalise the talk page as a group in order to eliminate contributions of non mormons who disturbed you and I found this unacceptable and against all wikis essentials rules.
I will therefor not bow under you threats and insist for the intervention of a non mormon administrator who isnt a personal friend as well.
There is clear discriminatorics actions who have to stop and being alone against 10, it is difficult but not all impossible.
I simply cant accept that a group of religious extremists insist on imposing their views on different talkpage at the cost of wikipedias rule of equality and neutrality and at the cost of real information as well.
 I am not hiding as you are all doing so at the moment nor lying and pretending something else.
I do reply to those attacks, but I have the dignity to leave place for the other users, and to dont revert their texts and to in fact reinsert their answers and questions with mine who were deleeted with theirs.
The excuse of archiving is very thin seen in the light of the real purpose, and rearrching in less than 24 hours, after only 4 posts, is unacceptable and to spit at wikipedias face.
Do you think that all wikipedians are idiots and cannot see what you are trying to do?
I was called a troll, a lyer many times, insulted, and anyway terminated my contributions and answers to this with: """"kind regards"""", that was until the joke went too far, and the insults too loud, and the circus was too obvious that I used a more direct language, but it was not before you started those mass reverting actions disguise as archiving that I really went angry and asked for proper explainations.
Which you answer to by reverting even more.
I dont accept this.
You have no rights to do so and your insistency at grabing at wikis morality and set of rules to cover up for your diffamations is both hysterical and an hypocrisie who do not fool anybody.
i can see that you have all a long time training at doing so as you exchan´ge each time who is going to bear the hat...this way each person remain innocent as the guilt is dispearsed among as many as possible.
Very smart, but not less dishonnest nor more invisible.
Try pronoïa instead of being all trying to found something wrong about me and come back to my first text to wich you never answered and most certainly never read to understand it. You read it to critisized it.
Here is the result of your crusade.
Are you happy with it?
I hope so, 'cause I dont found it satisfying at all.

Fear has nothing to do with it.  Your """"sources"""" are poorly-researched and biased themselves; Arbcom actually stated in relation to a case that FreemasonryWatch was too fantastical.  Yet you have your links listed as if they are completely true.  Like most critics of Freemasonry, you have a bad habit of taking things out of context.  However, if a Mason tells you you're wrong, it's """"Masonic bias"""", and apparently because we don't want you to reveal some deep, dark secret.  I know perfectrly well that people love conspiracy theories, so there's that to consider, but my main concern is that it appears to be that you are attempting to wage some sort of personal crusade.  Otherwise you wouldn't feel the need to publicize said material on your userpage.  The sources you have were discussed at length, and were shown to be inaccurate by objective evidence rather than personal opinion.  There is a difference.

Now, let's look at it this way: not being a Roman Catholic, if I were to turn around and say that """"Roman Catholics are pagans"""" because I could find instances where it was stated or claimed that Roman Catholics worship idols (largely by picking and choosing my quotes out of context as I saw fit), and tried to put it in an article, do you think it would be """"fear"""" on your part that would make you remove that information, or rather the simple fact that as a Roman Catholic, you know better and are aware that the statement is false?   Or would that be """"Roman Catholic bias""""? 

As for accuracy of sources, so-called """"Masonic sources"""" as fed through Ephesians, FMW, and other sites are inaccurate from a fundamental verifiability standpoint.  I would be more than happy to discuss all these various materials so you can see what they really say, but I just don't think they're user page appropriate.  """,0

 Drmies, the Irresponsible Hacksaw Deletionist, and the screenshot he doesn't want you to see 

The following was selectively deleted by Drmies

 

 

Are you fing kidding me? There are 30+ reliable sources listed in the pre-vandalism history of the page. This debate in this talk page has no importance and will not receive justice. I am making my objections public for the sake of posterity alone. If you want to see the sources:

 Go look at the history of the page pre-vandalism.
 Go look at the history of the talk page pre-vandalism.TAB
 Go look at the previous AfD discussion where 30+ sources are extensively discussed and analyzed, and consensus found that they were reliable according to the wikipedia definition of """"reliable"""" which you have not familiarized yourself with. 
TAB
This debate has already been done and it's very visible in the history of the page and the previous AfDs; the history which has not been consulted by the current deleters attacking this page. Without an """"admin in my pocket"""" my claims fall on deaf ears; I understand this all too well. If you or your allies were interested in due process, you would examine the history instead of asking that all that labour be repeated. Your kind will always demand that others do all the work even when it has been done in exhaustive detail. When you've read this entire page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Law_of_One then you may speak without embarassing yourself. Anyone who has not read that entire page and understood the poles of the debate speaks from ignorance and exposes themselves as lazy deleters happy to erase hours and hours of work without a care. Shame on all of you for your intellectual laziness, dishonesty, and irresponsible deleter reflexes.

"""About Claim of POV and grammar errors for this article==

To: speedoflight

Your claim of POV and grammar error are not clear and not helpful. For instance, I cannot see what's wrong with the sentence: """"As a versatile actor, Cheung also acted in many comedies."""" With all the different types of roles and movies he acted, it is proper to call him a versatile actor. In addition, all the movies talked in the same paragraph are comedies. As the names of movies are already given, people can easily check out by either checking the movie itself or going to imdb or any other movie related website. Neither is there any grammar error in this short sentence. Without this sentence, the whole paragraph became confusing and ridiculous. In addition, I keep telling you that Cheung's niece never explicitly said in his funeral that Cheung was suffered from depression. This can be verified by the video record of his funeral published by Cheung's family. However, you stick on introducing this mistake again and again. In addition, Ouyang Feng's job in the movie Ashes of Time is killer agent instead of assassin, this is easy to verify as the movie's name is given in the article. I don't know why you change it to the wrong one. You also remove the movie link of Happy together. I can't see any of these revisions made by you have anything to do with POV or Grammar error.

As for the subtitle """"Golden Age in Film"""", it is just to address the blooming period of Cheung's Film career. Changing to """"Height in career"""" did not show anything about Film. If you want to change it to something else, at least you should not ruin the meaning. I can see that you are very anti-Chinese media. However, You should not bring personal feeling in editing. I can understand and am tolerant with Chinese media doesn't mean I would trust them. In fact, I am trying to dig out references not just from news media, but also books and original interviews, which make the job time consuming.

Again, it's no problem and you are definitely welcome to do editing. However, you need to be careful not introduce new mistakes in the article. In addition, please explain you point clear for others to understand and check outAugest 

I keep telling you to be patient as I am still in my process to finger out a better way to put references and resources staff. However, you keep removing things in all kinds of excuses, introducing tons of mistakes, and making the article ambiguous. If you want to put whatever references you want, go ahead and do it. Or if anything you consider as needed a reference, EXPLICITLY POINTED OUT. Don't just rudely remove things with ridiculous reasons. Not """"EVERY"""" piece of sentence needs a reference, otherwise ALL articles in wiki should be removed. I spent THREE months to verify the information, correct errors and finish the current article. To dig out all the original resources may need another 3 months. I also need break during the Christmas season. Please be patient!!! Augest 

Please don't remove background or useful information when you do """"gramma"""" corrections. Augest 

I think it's better to put Chinese version of Cheung's suicide note in his Chinese version wiki page to reduce redundancy. However, I don't have time to do it yet.

As for the references, I am still trying to think a better way to include them, as there are too much about him, please be patient. Thank you for the suggestions though! Augest

 chimes in with his two cents supporting the same contention as the the last discredited guy.  He got his lame comment in before I posted the second two links. Those links were for the Associated Press and Government of Canada (but lots of other reliable places have this stuff).  He didn't back up his statement by responding with the source that he was referring to and lost credibility too. For this reason,  is also a Liar.  That's not all. This person must be the brains of this operation. Right here on this page  puts forth the argument that """"And none of this shows that there is no chemtrails conspiracy theory.""""

You don't know Charlotte, your selective enforcement policies are BULLSHIT, and you don't follow rules you are entrusted to enforce.",1
((unblock. First off it's justly my nature to use that fucking language alright and its a damn amendment in the constitution you pc bastard this why we can't do shit in this country anymore and should shove your bullshit degree up your ass cunt ass fuck face go get herpes you shithead bastardized fuck,1
"""Christ, you guys are unbelivable. I try to act like an adult and be nice, and all I get is more insults from Repubolican Jacobite...what a scum-bag. I edited the info box because """"contract Murder"""" was a westies hallmark, and should be included in the info box. And as I said before the stuff I put in the lead WAS in the lead for a long time and nobody had a problem with it untill that know-knothing jack-ass Republican Jacobite started his bullshit. He does not know about this group and I do, he can't deal with that fact. He should be banned, not me. I will continue to edit this page. I am willing to cut Niteshit some slack because he is a fellow veteran, but I have lost all patience with Republican jacobite.

"I used the exact same bullshit you wrote, hypocrite.",1
"First off, you're no one to tell me what edit becsuse what i did to the text is display one thing, THE TRUTH!  I watched every second of that relaity program and what I mentioned in the updates are the facts!  You blatantly lied about stuff that happened on the show and suggested that John Brown was this great rapper that everyone picked on!  You're full of shit just as much as John Brown!  JOHN BROWN IS BULLSHIT!

You don't like what I have to say here, go to hell where you belong.  I came on here to lay out the truth because your description of the show is FULL OF LIES!!!  Thank goodness I have a good memeory because I just exposed you for the fraud you are, FOOL!",1
"whosoever has mentioned yadavs as shudras is person with limited knowledge and mind filled with shit.....you are mentioning shudras to caste who has had glorious history,do you even know anything bout lord krishna and his ancestor yadu...yadavs are kshatriyas and if u think tht all this is myth thn you shud know that yadavs ruled the india upto 1300 contury before mughal rule...so kindly remove this shudras bullshit ..",1

In 1930, Balbo also did not fly into St. Petersburg, Mumbai or Ho Chi Minh City, because those cities were not called that in 1930 either.
If Balbo had flown in 1990, he would have flown into Derry, per your petty policy. (What sort of city needs a stupid policy like this, he asked rhetorically.) Ok? Have you got it now?
But this is not 1990, it's 1930.
If you don't understand the difference, why are you """"working"""" on an encyclopedia?
Eh? Eh?
Quit wasting my time with this bullshit.
Bullshit is what you are pushing. Bullshit.
Got it? Jesus H. Christ.  """,1
do you arrogant bastards have nothing better do than bitch about who edits what. what the fuck you probably live in your parents basement and bitch bout what goes on in a insignificant websiTe. this is a load of bullshit why don't you get a life and find something better to do you worthless piece of shit,1
how many people does this tit think i am? And whats with asking another editor who wants me banned to help out  this is fucking bullshit,1

 Good Faith, Bad Faith 

I assume good faith. It seems simply an act of confusion. 

Why would you assume good faith with this person, but not with me?   
You dismiss my perspective as """"nonsense and bullshit"""" and a cursory browsing of your Talk page reveals this is a somewhat common response, on your part, to DisagreementViolations of WP Tenants certainly as bad as those you cast at this newbie.

My initial comment that this is 'frivolous' was not meant to imply a bad faith MfD on your part (although I did consider it at first). The policy on userpages (nor much of anything on this site) is written in stoneI do not endorse your citation, nor do I agree with its application. I consider this a frivolous (and suprisingly devisive) issue. 

I wonder, regardless of where this vote goes, whether the world will be a better place afterwards. Obviously you think so, but from an airplane's perspective I see a tiny little person defending (like hell) everyone from a Username that hasn't offended anybody. """,1
