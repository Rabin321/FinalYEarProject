# ToxicCommentClassification


The aim of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify comments made on social media or any other platforms as toxic or non-toxic. The model will be trained on a large dataset of comments, and will use a variety of techniques such as natural language processing support vector machine to accurately classify the comments.

This project is still in the early stages of development, and there is still much work to be done to improve the accuracy and performance of the model.
